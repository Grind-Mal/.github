# GrindMal 🛠

**The ultimate dev grind ecosystem.**  
Decentralized. Leaderless. Beginner-friendly but unflinching.  
We don’t do tutorials, mentors, or hand-holding. We do **real broken projects, PRs, and peer review**.

---

## 📜 Philosophy

- **Artifacts > Opinions**  
  Learning happens through commits, PRs, diffs. Words alone don’t count.

- **Public struggle**  
  Every issue, failure, and fix is visible. Hiding doesn’t exist.

- **System > Leaders**  
  Rules and structure enforce behavior. Founders/admins are optional.

- **Beginner-accessible, effort-gated**  
  Anyone can join. Staying in requires contributions.

- **Real grind**  
  Work embedded in **actual open-source workflow**. Comfort zone optional.

## 🔄 Core Loop

1. A broken project or challenge is dropped in a repo.
2. Beginner opens an **Issue** describing their struggle.
3. Other contributors **fork** → fix → submit **PR**.
4. Peer review approves/rejects, with **minimal context explained**.
5. PR merged → everyone reads diffs → knowledge spreads.

> **No hand-holding. PR = help. Commit messages + minimal comments = learning artifacts.**

- `grindmal/challenges` → weekly challenges and exercises
- `grindmal/reviews` → review guidelines and templates

**Templates included:**

- Issue template → required logs, attempted solutions
- PR template → required minimal context + explanation of fix

## 🧭 Rules / Discipline

- **Help = PR only**
- **PR must include minimal context** (commit message + optional comment)
- **Reviewer must explain approval/rejection**
- **Stale PR/issues auto-closed**
- **No private help / Discord debugging**
- **Cycle contribution = minimum 1 PR or 1 review per week**
- **Dispute = submit alternative PR, not comment thread**

> Founder/admins do not rescue contributors. Execution discipline > comfort.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Fork a repo under `broken-projects` or `challenges`.
2. Attempt the issue or broken code.
3. Submit a PR with fixes + minimal context.
4. Review other PRs if possible.
5. Repeat. Grind. Improve.

> Check `onboarding/first-issue.md` for the very first PR you must submit to start the cycle.

## ⚠️ What this is NOT

- Not a bootcamp
- Not a tutorial site
- Not a hand-holding community
- Not a leaderboard/gamified site (stats only for transparency)

**This is a dev grind. Only real work survives.**
